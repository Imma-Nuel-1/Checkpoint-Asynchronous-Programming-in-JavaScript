# Async/Await Tasks

This project demonstrates the use of `async`/`await` in JavaScript through various tasks. It includes examples of iterating with `async`/`await`, awaiting API calls, and handling concurrent requests.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 01: Iterating with Async/Await

The `iterateWithAsyncAwait` function takes an array of values and logs each value with a delay of 1 second between logs.

### Task 02: Awaiting a Call

The `awaitCall` function simulates fetching data from an API. It uses `await` to wait for the API response and logs the data. It also includes error handling to manage any issues during the API call.

### Task 04: Awaiting Concurrent Requests

The `concurrentRequests` function makes two API calls concurrently using `Promise.all()`. It logs the combined results after both requests have resolved.
